# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to **WordWorld**!


### 1. Commit Guidelines
For efficient code review, *`make one commit per logical change`* and keep changes small to
speed up the process and simplify troubleshooting. Avoid mixing whitespace changes with
functional updates, and separate unrelated functional changes into distinct commits. Use the
imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add preprocessing step") and keep the subject
concise, ideally under 60 characters. Focus on what the change does, not how it’s done, and
format references to issues or PRs like "Add LLaMA-3.2 [#2]". Optionally, use emoji codes for
clarity.


**This is an Optional** but feel free to use the following emoji codes in your message.
